# robot-wheel
# Brief :
- This task consider a part of building a robot. 
- We are using H-bridge to control the direction of 2 DC motors, later we can add wheels to the motors and sensors to drive the robot automatically.
# the work: 
- At first we have to identifiy each pin of the H-bridge and its function. So, we can design the [circuit digram](https://github.com/FarisA1999/robot-wheel-/blob/main/controlling%202%20DC%20motors%20with%20bridge.png)
- Next we have to write [Arduino code](https://github.com/FarisA1999/robot-wheel-/blob/main/controlling%202%20DC%20motors%20with%20bridge.ino) to change the direction of the motors after specific period. 
- Later we can insert a sensor and use it to control the directions of the motors.
